# Image processing

Test data is provided in a zipped folder

## Duckplate app (Python)
See Duckplate folder or Tiago's repository. Note that 1=plate on right side, 2=plate on left side.

**Currently needs to be updated**

## Using Symbiont
See the PDF of instructions on how to process images using the Symbiont server. **Newly updated November 19, 2023**

Check your version of protobuf by running 'pip show protobuf'. You may need to downgrade your version 3.20.x or lower if you are encountering an error.

## Process images using a web browser
This should prevent any compatibility issues (e.g., work on Mac and Windows). Tiago made a Colab notebook, see Slack for the edit link. **Updated November 18, 2023:** Please ask Jessie for the link to v2 of the Colab notebook.
