# Image processing

Test data is provided in a zipped folder

**Currently needs to be updated**

## Using Symbiont
See the PDF of instructions on how to process images using the Symbiont server.
Check your version of protobuf by running 'pip show protobuf'. You may need to downgrade your version 3.20.x or lower if you are encountering an error.

## Process images using a web browser
This should prevent any compatibility issues (e.g., work on Mac and Windows). Tiago made a Colab notebook, see Slack for the edit link. A copy of this notebook is available here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-sieeRsfEuzY-PkkIzRHsgHX0xoL6Tgp?usp=sharing (this link only allows commenting).
