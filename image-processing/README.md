# Image processing

Test data is provided in a zipped folder

## Duckplate app (Python)
See Duckplate folder or Tiago's repository.

## Using Symbiont
See PDF of instructions from Tiago on how to process images using the Symbiont server.

## Process images using a web browser
This should prevent any compatibility issues (e.g., work on Mac and Windows). Tiago made a Colab notebook, see slack for the edit link. A copy of this notebook is available here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-sieeRsfEuzY-PkkIzRHsgHX0xoL6Tgp?usp=sharing (this link only allows commenting).
